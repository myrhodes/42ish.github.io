title: Facebook page for Pakistanis applying for Rhodes Scholarships
---

After a recent query, I have created a facebook page for people who are applying for Rhodes Scholarships in Pakistan. The purpose of the group is to serve as a knowledge and experience sharing platform, where people can share advice and ask any queries that remain unanswered after reading the posts on this blog.
Feel free to join.
Group is called: Applying for Rhodes Scholarship in Pakistan
