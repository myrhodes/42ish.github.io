title: My advice to Chokkas
---

I am a Chokka. A chokka is a slang term for a person who secures 4.0/4.0 GPA. And my 4.0 CGPA at PNEC, NUST gave me a permanent membership of that club.

Most people assume that chokkas have it all figured out and life is easy for them in university. Yes you are right, we know everything already, be afraid, be very afraid. No, I am kidding, for the most part chokkas have the same fears and apprehensions as the rest of the folk, the only difference is that for a poor student there is no way to go but up, for a chokka the only way is down. This persistent struggle for consistency takes a good toll of our nerves and therefore most chokkas seem to be frazzled folks. But there are some important things that I want my fellow chokkas to remember:

* Try to make your university experience well-rounded
* Don't forget to make good friends
* Make friends with diverse interests, it will help you to see the world in more interesting ways
* Follow multiple passions, indulge in sports, magazine design, photography, chess, run in elections for societies in university, travel with your friends, write stories/essays/articles, explore your city
* Keep a good posture and learn good body language
* Work on interpersonal skills, we all need them
* Stop being the teacher's obvious pet, you will make the grade in any case
* Help out your friends with their studies, you can and you should
* Get involved in social work and make a dent in your surroundings
* Try to make a positive impact in the life of your student fellows
* Stop telling your friends that you didn't really prepare for the test, we all know you did
* Stop telling your friends that your test didn't go well, we don't believe you
* Try to carry out some good research work, that will help in your quest for future studies
* Apply for a job that matches your interests
* Keep preparing slowly for your GRE
* Read books on a diverse range of subjects
* Find inner peace, through whatever means you prefer
* Have fun
* Keep getting the 4.0
