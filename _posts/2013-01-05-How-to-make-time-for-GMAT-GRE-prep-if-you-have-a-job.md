title: How to make time for GMAT or GRE prep if you have a job
---

If you are looking for a short cut, you won't find it here.

In my experience, the best way to prepare for the GMAT/GRE while keeping a full time job is to start 2 months before your intended test date. Study like hell and get it over with. By study like hell I mean the program that I followed as outlined in my previous post. You will have to force yourself to take up the vocabulary list after coming back from a long office day and stay focused on the job at hand until you reach your daily word/study/problems target. It is no easy feat, I know, but the aim here is to get a GRE/GMAT score that puts you securely at the top of the achievers list. For two months everything else outside office should take the back burner. You should still allocate set amounts of time for your friends and family, but you should convey to them what you are trying to achieve and why it is important to you. They will understand. And once you get that awesome high score they will be proud of you and tell the whole world about your amazing achievement!
